# Why
#
# I was using the following command:
# 'dotnet nuget push ./*.nupkg --api-key <api-key> --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --skip-duplicate'
# to push a nuget package and its symbols to NuGet.org
#
# The problem was that even if the nuget package already existed the '--skip-duplicate' flag only makes it so that
# the nuget push command doesn't fail due to the returned 409 from the server but it still tries to push the
# symbols package after.
#
# The above doesn't fail but it makes NuGet.org send emails to the owner of the package with the following:
#
# 'Symbols package publishing failed. The associated symbols package could not be published due to the following reason(s):
# The uploaded symbols package contains pdb(s) for a corresponding dll(s) not found in the nuget package.
# Once you've fixed the issue with your symbols package, you can re-upload it.
#
# Please note: The last successfully published symbols package is still available for debugging and download.'
#
# The above error message is also displayed on the nuget's package page even though it's only visible to the owner of the package.
#
# To avoid this happening the action below will attempt to do a push first only of the nuget package and only if it succeeds
# attempts to do a following push of the symbols package.
# If the nuget push returns a 409 because the package exists that is outputted by the action and the symbols push is skipped.
# If the nuget push fails because of any other reason the output from nuget push is outputted by the action and the symbols push is skipped.

        # is coded NONE of the symbol packages (*.snupkg) will be pushed. This action could be improved to either:
        # - accept the .nupgk and .snupgk filenames and push just those
        # - understand which .nupgk succeeded and push the corresponding symbols packages (.snupkg).
