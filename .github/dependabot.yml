    # I've decided to comment out the `ignore` block because otherwise I just forget to check these dependencies for updates.
    # What I will test by commenting this out is that:
    # 1) Dependabot will create PRs to update these dependencies
    # 2) These PRs should fail on the build workflow due to updating the dependencies on the older TFMs to latest version of these nuget packages.
    # This happens because the latest versions of the packages are only supported on newer TFMs.
    # 3) I'll close the dependabot PRs but now I'll be aware that there is a new version and I'll manually do the PR to update the version on the
    # new TFMs and hopefully remember to check if there is an update for the versions used on the older TFMs.
    # 4) UPDATE: I had disabled the ignore rule because I wanted to see the PRs anyway, even if they failed as explained above but recently dependabot
    # started to fail and doesn't generate any PR. It fails with "Unhandled exception: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.
    # Key: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing". So I'm enabling the ignore below again to avoid Dependabot failing.
    ignore:
      # Ignored because the csproj using this  NuGet supports multiple target frameworks and dependabot does not handle this well.
      # This NuGet needs to be manually updated for each target framework
