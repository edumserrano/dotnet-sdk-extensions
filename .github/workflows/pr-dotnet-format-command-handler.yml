# Unlike other workflows this one does not have a concurrency defined. If we define a concurrency then a workflow run
# that was triggered by the expected comment could get cancelled by any other following comment added to the pull request.
#
# As an alternative we could consider adding the comment body (github.event.comment.body) to the concurrency group id.
# This would mean that workflows would only get cancelled if they had the same comment body, which would mean that for
# all comments with the same body all workflows in progress would get cancelled except for the last.
#
# Downsides with the approach having the github.event.comment.body as part of the concurrency group id:
#
# - workflow runs might fail to start because of invalid characters used in comments or because of comment size. Functionally this is not a problem
# because the workflow would always run for the expected comment. However, the workflow history would show fail runs for this error cases which is
# not great.
#
# - the purpose of this workflow is to run dotnet format and push changes to the PR. If the workflow is cancelled after the changes are pushed to
# the PR but before the workflow finishes then we end up in a potential invalid state. Meaning, if for instance I want to take an action after the
# changes are pushed, such as adding a comment to the PR, then the workflow could get cancelled before the comment is made on the PR.
# In short, there are parts of the workflow that once started should be finished, the workflow should NOT be allowed to be aborted to avoid getting into
# a bad state.
#
# Mainly because of the second downside I decided to NOT add a concurrency group based on the comment body

        ## Note
        Sometimes the fix provided by the analyzers produces unecessary comments when formatting files.

        This should only happen if the project supports multiple target frameworks and the fix doesn't produce the same output for all. However, it seems that sometimes the ``Unmerged change from project ...`` comment shows up even though the fix produced the same output.

        If this happens, just delete the comments added. Otherwise, consider incorporating the commented out code using [preprocessor directives to control conditional compilation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#conditional-compilation).
        Example:
        ``````csharp
        #if NET5_0
            ...
        #elif NETCOREAPP3_1
            ...
        #endif
        ``````
