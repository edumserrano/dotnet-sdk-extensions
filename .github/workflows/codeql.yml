# As per documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#avoiding-unnecessary-scans-of-pull-requests
# For CodeQL code scanning workflow files, don't use the paths-ignore or paths keywords with the on:push event
# as this is likely to cause missing analyses. For accurate results, CodeQL code scanning needs to be able to
# compare new changes with the analysis of the previous commit.
