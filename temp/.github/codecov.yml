# The setting 'allow_coverage_offsets=true' is to avoid errors that sometimes occur when trying to 
# view coverage on codecov.io for pull requests
#
# What might happen is that the commit from the base branch of the pull request does not have 
# code coverage information because currently the pipelines that generate code coverage only
# run for specific folders. Eg: 
#
# Do some documentation changes on the existing .md files will not trigger the pipeline which
# generates code coverage. In this case, Codecov tries to use pseudo comparison to find an 
# appropriate substitute to the pull request base commit which has code coverage information. 
# However, sometimes the pseudo base chosen is not good enough and the option allow_coverage_offsets
# helps resolve this.
#
# For more info read https://docs.codecov.com/docs/comparing-commits#pseudo-comparison.
