# Add a set of resilience policies to an HttpClient

## Motivation

Every time I use an `HttpClient` I end up repeating the same [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) usage pattern in my projects to a set of resilience polices such as:

- fallback
- retry
- circuit breaker
- timeout

Plus, at times I want to have the values for configuring the policies read from the `appsettings.json` which further increases the code I keep repeating.

## Requirements

You will have to add the [DotNet-Sdk-Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNet-Sdk-Extensions) nuget to your project.

## How to use

The extension method provided `AddResiliencePolicies` is an extension to the `IHttpClientBuilder` which is what you use when [configuring an HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

This extension combines 4 extension methods into one:

- [Add a timeout policy to an HttpClient](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-timeout-policy.md)
- [Add a retry policy to an HttpClient](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-retry-policy.md)
- [Add a circuit breaker policy to an HttpClient](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-circuit-breaker-policy.md)
- [Add a fallback policy to an HttpClient](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-fallback-policy.md)

From the documentation of the above 4 extension methods it is usefull to read the following:

- The intro of the [`How to use`](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-fallback-policy.md#how-to-use) section of the AddFallbackPolicy extension method: it explains what the fallback policy is configured to handle and which fallback responses are returned. The same applies to the fallback policy added by the  `AddResiliencePolicies` extension.
- The section [`Differentiate different fallback response types`](/docs/polly/httpclient-with-fallback-policy.md#distinguish-different-fallback-response-types) from the AddFallbackPolicy extension method: the same applies to a response returned by an `HttpClient` configured with the `AddResiliencePolicies` extension.

### Basic example

You can add the resilience policies by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddResiliencePolicies(options =>
    {
        options.Timeout.TimeoutInSecs = 1;

        options.Retry.RetryCount = 2;
        options.Retry.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;

        options.CircuitBreaker.MinimumThroughput = 10;
        options.CircuitBreaker.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;
        options.CircuitBreaker.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10;
        options.CircuitBreaker.FailureThreshold = 0.5;
    });
```

The above example is the simplest way to use the extension method. Note that:

- even though the example shows adding the resilience policies to a named `HttpClient` you can also add it to typed `HttpClient` because the extension method works on the `IHttpClientBuilder`.
  
- the configuration of the policies' options is done inline but the extension method is also integrated with the all the ecosystem around the [Options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0) in dotnet core, such as the possibility of binding the options values from the `appsettings`. See [Binding appsettings values to the resilience policies options](#binding-appsettings-values-to-the-resilience-policies-options).
  
- you can provide a class to handle the events produced by the resilience policies. See [Handling events from the resilience policies](#handling-events-from-the-resilience-policies).

### ResilienceOptions

The `ResilienceOptions` provides the following configuration options for the resilience policies.

#### For the timeout policy options

- `TimeoutInSecs`: Timeout value in seconds. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean a timeout of 100 milliseconds.

#### For the retry policy options

- `RetryCount`: maximum number of retries. Must be a value between zero and `int.MaxValue`.
- `MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs`:  median delay to target before the first retry. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.

#### For the circuit breaker policy options

- `FailureThreshold`: failure threshold at which the circuit will break, eg 0.5 represents breaking if 50% or more of actions result in a handled failure. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and 1.
- `SamplingDurationInSecs`:  duration of the timeslice over which failure ratios are assessed. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.
- `MinimumThroughput`: this many actions or more must pass through the circuit in the timeslice for statistics to be considered significant and the circuit-breaker to come into action. Must be a value between 2 and `int.MaxValue`.
- `DurationOfBreakInSecs`: duration the circuit will stay open before resetting. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.

#### Policy control options

- `EnableFallbackPolicy`: whether or not the fallback policy added to the `HttpClient`. Enabled by default.
- `EnableRetryPolicy`: whether or not the retry policy added to the `HttpClient`. Enabled by default.
- `EnableCircuitBreakerPolicy`: whether or not the circuit breaker policy added to the `HttpClient`. Enabled by default.
- `EnableTimeoutPolicy`: whether or not the timeout policy added to the `HttpClient`. Enabled by default.

If you want to [bind the configuration from the appsettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#bind-hierarchical-configuration) remember that the name of the key in the appsettings must match the property names of the `ResilienceOptions` for the bind to work.

### Binding appsettings values to the resilience policies options

Imagine that you have an appsettings file with the following:

```json
"MyHttpClient": {
    "EnableFallbackPolicy": true,
    "EnableRetryPolicy": true,
    "EnableCircuitBreakerPolicy": true,
    "EnableTimeoutPolicy": true,

    "TimeoutInSecs": "1",

    "RetryCount": "2",
    "MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs": "1",

    "FailureThreshold": 0.5,
    "SamplingDurationInSecs": 10,
    "MinimumThroughput": 8,
    "DurationOfBreakInSecs": 30
}
```

You can add the set resilience policies that are configured from the values on the appsettings file by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClientResilienceOptions("my-resilience-options")
    .Bind(Configuration.GetSection("MyHttpClient"));

services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddResiliencePolicies("my-resilience-options");
```

The `services.AddHttpClientResilienceOptions` adds a named options of type `ResilienceOptions` and returns an instance of `OptionsBuilder<ResilienceOptions>`, which means you can now use any of the methods provided by dotnet to configure it such as for example:

- [Options validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-validation)
- [Options post-configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-post-configuration)

### Handling events from the resilience policies

This extension method also enables you to access the events provided by all of the resilience Polly policies added to the `HttpClient`.

You can specify a class to handle the events from the policies by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddResiliencePolicies<MyResilienceEventHandler>(options =>
    {
        options.Timeout.TimeoutInSecs = 1;
        options.Retry.RetryCount = 2;
        options.Retry.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;
        options.CircuitBreaker.MinimumThroughput = 10;
        options.CircuitBreaker.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;
        options.CircuitBreaker.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10;
        options.CircuitBreaker.FailureThreshold = 0.5;
    });
```

The `MyResilienceEventHandler` must implement the `IResiliencePoliciesEventHandler` interface.

```csharp
public class MyResilienceEventHandler : IResiliencePoliciesEventHandler
    {
        private readonly ILogger<MyResilienceEventHandler> _logger;

        public MyResilienceEventHandler(ILogger<MyResilienceEventHandler> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public Task OnTimeoutAsync(TimeoutEvent timeoutEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"A timeout has occurred on the HttpClient {timeoutEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnRetryAsync(RetryEvent retryEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Retry {retryEvent.RetryNumber} out of {retryEvent.RetryOptions.RetryCount} for HttpClient {retryEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnBreakAsync(BreakEvent breakEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned from {breakEvent.PreviousState} to open/isolated for the HttpClient {breakEvent.HttpClientName}. Break will last for {breakEvent.DurationOfBreak}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnHalfOpenAsync(HalfOpenEvent halfOpenEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned to half open for the HttpClient {halfOpenEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnResetAsync(ResetEvent resetEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned to closed for the HttpClient {resetEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
        
        public Task OnHttpRequestExceptionFallbackAsync(FallbackEvent fallbackEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Fallback response returned due to HttpRequestException for the HttpClient {fallbackEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnTimeoutFallbackAsync(FallbackEvent fallbackEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Fallback response returned due to timeout for the HttpClient {fallbackEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnBrokenCircuitFallbackAsync(FallbackEvent fallbackEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Fallback response returned due to broken circuit for the HttpClient {fallbackEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnTaskCancelledFallbackAsync(FallbackEvent fallbackEvent)
        {
            //do something like logging
            _logger.LogInformation($"Fallback response returned due to TaskCancelledException for the HttpClient {fallbackEvent.HttpClientName}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
```

With the above whenever an event is triggered from any of the resilience policies on the `my-http-client` `HttpClient` there will be a log message for it.

There are overloads that enable you to have more control on how the instance that will handle the events is created. For this specic example it doesn't make much sense but could use the overload as follows:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddResiliencePolicies(
        configureOptions: options =>
        {
            options.Timeout.TimeoutInSecs = 1;
            options.Retry.RetryCount = 2;
            options.Retry.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;
            options.CircuitBreaker.MinimumThroughput = 10;
            options.CircuitBreaker.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;
            options.CircuitBreaker.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10;
            options.CircuitBreaker.FailureThreshold = 0.5;
        },
        eventHandlerFactory: provider =>
        {
            var loggerFactory = provider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
            var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyResilienceEventHandler>();
            return new MyResilienceEventHandler(logger);
        });
```

For the majority of the cases the overload that accepts a genericy type `AddResiliencePolicies<T>` is what is more likely to be used since whatever dependencies you need to provide to the type `T` can be passed through the constructor as long as they are added to the `IServiceCollection`.
