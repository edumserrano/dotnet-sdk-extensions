# Add a retry policy to an HttpClient

## Motivation

Every time I use an `HttpClient` I end up repeating the same [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) usage pattern in my projects to add a retry policy.

Plus, at times I want to have the values for configuring the retry policy read from the `appsettings.json` which further increases the code I keep repeating.

## Requirements

You will have to add the [DotNet-Sdk-Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNet-Sdk-Extensions) nuget to your project.

## How to use

The extension method provided `AddRetryPolicy` is an extension to the `IHttpClientBuilder` which is what you use when [configuring an HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

This extension will add the retry policy provided by [Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry) to the `HttpClient`.
This policy was chosen because of its more advanced jitter support. For more info see:

- [Retry with jitter](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Retry-with-jitter)
- [Wait and Retry with Jittered Back-off](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry#wait-and-retry-with-jittered-back-off)

### Basic example

You can add a retry policy by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddRetryPolicy(options =>
    {
        options.RetryCount = 2;
        options.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;
    });
```

The above example is the simplest way to use the extension method. Note that:

- even though the example shows adding a retry policy to a named `HttpClient` you can also add it to typed `HttpClient` because the extension method works on the `IHttpClientBuilder`.
  
- the configuration of the policy's options is done inline but the extension method is also integrated with the all the ecosystem around the [Options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0) in dotnet core, such as the possibility of binding the options values from the `appsettings`. See [Binding appsettings values to the retry policy options](#binding-appsettings-values-to-the-retry-policy-options).
  
- you can provide a class to handle the events produced by the retry policy. See [Handling events from the retry policy](#handling-events-from-the-retry-policy).

### RetryOptions

The `RetryOptions` provides the following configuration options for the retry policy:

- `RetryCount`: maximum number of retries. Must be a value between zero and `int.MaxValue`.
- `MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs`:  median delay to target before the first retry. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.

If you want to [bind the configuration from the appsettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#bind-hierarchical-configuration) remember that the name of the key in the appsettings must match the property names of the `RetryOptions` for the bind to work.

### Binding appsettings values to the retry policy options

Imagine that you have an appsettings file with the following:

```json
"MyHttpClient": {
    "RetryCount": "2",
    "MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs": "1",
}
```

You can add a retry policy that is configured from the values on the appsettings file by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClientRetryOptions("my-retry-options")
    .Bind(Configuration.GetSection("MyHttpClient"));

services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddRetryPolicy("my-retry-options");
```

The `services.AddHttpClientRetryOptions` adds a named options of type `RetryOptions` and returns an instance of `OptionsBuilder<RetryOptions>`, which means you can now use any of the methods provided by dotnet to configure it such as for example:

- [Options validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-validation)
- [Options post-configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-post-configuration)

### Handling events from the retry policy

This extension method also enables you to access the events provided by Polly's retry policy.

You can specify a class to handle the retry events by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddRetryPolicy<MyRetryEventHandler>(options =>
    {
        options.RetryCount = 2;
        options.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;
    });
```

The `MyRetryEventHandler` must implement the `IRetryPolicyEventHandler` interface.

```csharp
public class MyRetryEventHandler : IRetryPolicyEventHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyRetryEventHandler> _logger;

    public MyRetryEventHandler(ILogger<MyRetryEventHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public Task OnRetryAsync(RetryEvent retryEvent)
    {
        //do something like logging
        _logger.LogInformation($"Retry {retryEvent.RetryNumber} out of {retryEvent.RetryOptions.RetryCount} for HttpClient {retryEvent.HttpClientName}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

With the above whenever a retry occurs on the `my-http-client` `HttpClient` there will be a log message for it.

There are overloads that enable you to have more control on how the instance that will handle the events is created. For this specic example it doesn't make much sense but could use the overload as follows:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddRetryPolicy(
        configureOptions: options =>
        {
            options.RetryCount = 2;
            options.MedianFirstRetryDelayInSecs = 1;
        },
        eventHandlerFactory: provider =>
        {
            var loggerFactory = provider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
            var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyRetryEventHandler>();
            return new MyRetryEventHandler(logger);
        });
```

For the majority of the cases the overload that accepts a genericy type `AddRetryPolicy<T>` is what is more likely to be used since whatever dependencies you need to provide to the type `T` can be passed through the constructor as long as they are added to the `IServiceCollection`.
