# Add a circuit breaker policy to an HttpClient

## Motivation

Every time I use an `HttpClient` I end up repeating the same [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) usage pattern in my projects to add a circuit breaker policy.

Plus, at times I want to have the values for configuring the circuit breaker policy read from the `appsettings.json` which further increases the code I keep repeating.

## Requirements

You will have to add the [DotNet-Sdk-Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNet-Sdk-Extensions) nuget to your project.

## How to use

The extension method provided `AddCircuitBreakerPolicy` is an extension to the `IHttpClientBuilder` which is what you use when [configuring an HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

This extension will add a [circuit breaker policy](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly#advanced-circuit-breaker) wrapped with a [circuit breaker checker policy](/docs/polly/circuit-breaker-checker-policy.md) to the `HttpClient`.

### Basic example

You can add a circuit breaker policy by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddCircuitBreakerPolicy(options =>
    {
        options.FailureThreshold = 0.5;      // break on >=50% actions result in failures
        options.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10; // over any 10 second period
        options.MinimumThroughput = 8;       // provided at least 8 actions in the 10 second period
        options.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;  // break for 30 seconds
    });
```

The above example is the simplest way to use the extension method. Note that:

- even though the example shows adding a circuit breaker policy to a named `HttpClient` you can also add it to typed `HttpClient` because the extension method works on the `IHttpClientBuilder`.
  
- the configuration of the policy's options is done inline but the extension method is also integrated with the all the ecosystem around the [Options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0) in dotnet core, such as the possibility of binding the options values from the `appsettings`. See [Binding appsettings values to the circuit breaker policy options](#binding-appsettings-values-to-the-circuit-breaker-policy-options).
  
- you can provide a class to handle the events produced by the circuit breaker policy. See [Handling events from the circuit breaker policy](#handling-events-from-the-circuit-breaker-policy).

### CircuitBreakerOptions

The `CircuitBreakerOptions` provides the following configuration options for the circuit breaker policy:

- `FailureThreshold`: failure threshold at which the circuit will break, eg 0.5 represents breaking if 50% or more of actions result in a handled failure. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and 1.
- `SamplingDurationInSecs`:  duration of the timeslice over which failure ratios are assessed. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.
- `MinimumThroughput`: this many actions or more must pass through the circuit in the timeslice for statistics to be considered significant and the circuit-breaker to come into action. Must be a value between 2 and `int.MaxValue`.
- `DurationOfBreakInSecs`: duration the circuit will stay open before resetting. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean 100 milliseconds.

If you want to [bind the configuration from the appsettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#bind-hierarchical-configuration) remember that the name of the key in the appsettings must match the property names of the `CircuitBreakerOptions` for the bind to work.

### Binding appsettings values to the circuit breaker policy options

Imagine that you have an appsettings file with the following:

```json
"MyHttpClient": {
    "FailureThreshold": 0.5,
    "SamplingDurationInSecs": 10,
    "MinimumThroughput": 8,
    "DurationOfBreakInSecs": 30
}
```

You can add a circuit breaker policy that is configured from the values on the appsettings file by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClientCircuitBreakerOptions("my-circuit-breaker-options")
    .Bind(Configuration.GetSection("MyHttpClient"));

services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddCircuitBreakerPolicy("my-circuit-breaker-options");
```

The `services.AddHttpClientCircuitBreakerOptions` adds a named options of type `CircuitBreakerOptions` and returns an instance of `OptionsBuilder<CircuitBreakerOptions>`, which means you can now use any of the methods provided by dotnet to configure it such as for example:

- [Options validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-validation)
- [Options post-configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-post-configuration)

### Handling events from the circuit breaker policy

This extension method also enables you to access the events provided by Polly's circuit breaker policy.

You can specify a class to handle the circuit breaker events by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddCircuitBreakerPolicy<MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler>(options =>
    {
        options.FailureThreshold = 0.5;
        options.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10;
        options.MinimumThroughput = 8;
        options.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;
    });
```

The `MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler` must implement the `ICircuitBreakerPolicyEventHandler` interface.

```csharp
public class MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler : ICircuitBreakerPolicyEventHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler> _logger;

    public MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler(ILogger<MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public Task OnBreakAsync(BreakEvent breakEvent)
    {
        //do something like logging
        _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned from {breakEvent.PreviousState} to open/isolated for the HttpClient {breakEvent.HttpClientName}. Break will last for {breakEvent.DurationOfBreak}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OnHalfOpenAsync(HalfOpenEvent halfOpenEvent)
    {
        //do something like logging
        _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned to half open for the HttpClient {halfOpenEvent.HttpClientName}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OnResetAsync(ResetEvent resetEvent)
    {
        //do something like logging
        _logger.LogInformation($"Circuit state transitioned to closed for the HttpClient {resetEvent.HttpClientName}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

With the above whenever a circuit breaker event occurs on the `my-http-client` `HttpClient` there will be a log message for it.

There are overloads that enable you to have more control on how the instance that will handle the events is created. For this specic example it doesn't make much sense but could use the overload as follows:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddCircuitBreakerPolicy(
        configureOptions: options =>
        {
            options.FailureThreshold = 0.5;
            options.SamplingDurationInSecs = 10;
            options.MinimumThroughput = 8;
            options.DurationOfBreakInSecs = 30;
        },
        eventHandlerFactory: provider =>
        {
            var loggerFactory = provider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
            var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler>();
            return new MyCircuitBreakerEventHandler(logger);
        });
```

For the majority of the cases the overload that accepts a genericy type `AddCircuitBreakerPolicy<T>` is what is more likely to be used since whatever dependencies you need to provide to the type `T` can be passed through the constructor as long as they are added to the `IServiceCollection`.

### Note about the circuit breaker checker policy

The `AddCircuitBreakerPolicy` extension method adds a [circuit breaker checker policy](/docs/polly/circuit-breaker-checker-policy.md) that is evaluated before the circuit breaker policy.

When the circuit's state is open/isolated the circuit breaker checker policy avoids an exception being thrown and returns a instance of `CircuitBrokenHttpResponseMessage` which derives from `HttpResponseMessage` and has a status code 500.
