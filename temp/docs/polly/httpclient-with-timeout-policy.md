# Add a timeout policy to an HttpClient

## Motivation

Every time I use an `HttpClient` I end up repeating the same [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) usage pattern in my projects to add a timeout policy.

Plus, at times I want to have the values for configuring the timeout policy read from the `appsettings.json` which further increases the code I keep repeating.

## Requirements

You will have to add the [DotNet-Sdk-Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNet-Sdk-Extensions) nuget to your project.

## How to use

The extension method provided `AddTimeoutPolicy` is an extension to the `IHttpClientBuilder` which is what you use when [configuring an HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

This extension will add a [timeout policy](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly#timeout) to the `HttpClient`.

### Basic example

You can add a timeout policy by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddTimeoutPolicy(options =>
    {
        options.TimeoutInSecs = 1;
    });
```

The above example is the simplest way to use the extension method. Note that:

- even though the example shows adding a timeout policy to a named `HttpClient` you can also add it to typed `HttpClient` because the extension method works on the `IHttpClientBuilder`.
  
- the configuration of the policy's options is done inline but the extension method is also integrated with the all the ecosystem around the [Options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0) in dotnet core, such as the possibility of binding the options values from the `appsettings`. See [Binding appsettings values to the timeout policy options](#binding-appsettings-values-to-the-timeout-policy-options).
  
- you can provide a class to handle the events produced by the timeout policy. See [Handling events from the timeout policy](#handling-events-from-the-timeout-policy).

### TimeoutOptions

The `TimeoutOptions` provides the following configuration options for the timeout policy:

- `TimeoutInSecs`: Timeout value in seconds. Must be a value between `double.Epsilon` and `double.MaxValue`. You can represent values smaller than 1 second by using a decimal number such as 0.1 which would mean a timeout of 100 milliseconds.

If you want to [bind the configuration from the appsettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#bind-hierarchical-configuration) remember that the name of the key in the appsettings must match the property names of the `TimeoutOptions` for the bind to work.

### Binding appsettings values to the timeout policy options

Imagine that you have an appsettings file with the following:

```json
"MyHttpClient": {
    "TimeoutInSecs": "1"
}
```

You can add a timeout policy that is configured from the values on the appsettings file by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClientTimeoutOptions("my-timeout-options")
    .Bind(Configuration.GetSection("MyHttpClient"));

services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddTimeoutPolicy("my-timeout-options");
```

The `services.AddHttpClientTimeoutOptions` adds a named options of type `TimeoutOptions` and returns an instance of `OptionsBuilder<TimeoutOptions>`, which means you can now use any of the methods provided by dotnet to configure it such as for example:

- [Options validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-validation)
- [Options post-configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0#options-post-configuration)

### Handling events from the timeout policy

This extension method also enables you to access the events provided by Polly's timeout policy.

You can specify a class to handle the timeout events by doing the following:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddTimeoutPolicy<MyTimeoutEventHandler>(options =>
    {
        options.TimeoutInSecs = 1;
    });
```

The `MyTimeoutEventHandler` must implement the `ITimeoutPolicyEventHandler` interface.

```csharp
public class MyTimeoutEventHandler : ITimeoutPolicyEventHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyTimeoutEventHandler> _logger;

    public MyTimeoutEventHandler(ILogger<MyTimeoutEventHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public Task OnTimeoutAsync(TimeoutEvent timeoutEvent)
    {
        //do something like logging
        _logger.LogInformation($"A timeout has occurred on the HttpClient {timeoutEvent.HttpClientName}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

With the above whenever a timeout occurs on the `my-http-client` `HttpClient` there will be a log message for it.

There are overloads that enable you to have more control on how the instance that will handle the events is created. For this specic example it doesn't make much sense but could use the overload as follows:

```csharp
services
    .AddHttpClient("my-http-client")
    .AddTimeoutPolicy(
        configureOptions: options =>
        {
            options.TimeoutInSecs = 1;
        },
        eventHandlerFactory: provider =>
        {
            var loggerFactory = provider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
            var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyTimeoutEventHandler>();
            return new MyTimeoutEventHandler(logger);
        });
```

For the majority of the cases the overload that accepts a genericy type `AddTimeoutPolicy<T>` is what is more likely to be used since whatever dependencies you need to provide to the type `T` can be passed through the constructor as long as they are added to the `IServiceCollection`.
